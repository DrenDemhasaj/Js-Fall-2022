    startsWith -> The startsWith() method returns true if a string starts with a specified string. 
    Otherwise it returns false . The startsWith() method is case sensitive. See also the endsWith() method.

    endsWith -> endsWith() The endsWith() method determines whether a string
     ends with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate.

     includes -> The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries,
      returning true or false as appropriate.

    replace,The replace() method returns a new string with one, some, or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement . 
    The pattern can be a string or a RegExp , and the replacement can be a string or a function called for each match. 
    If pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced.


     concat ->The concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays.
     This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.
    trim, 

    padStart-> The padStart() method pads the current string with another string (multiple times, if needed
       until the resulting string reaches the given length.
        The padding is applied from the start of the current string.


    padEnd-> padEnd() The padEnd() method pads the current string with a given string (repeated, if needed) 
    so that the resulting string reaches a given length.
     The padding is applied from the end of the current string

    charAt-> The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string.
     The index of the first character is 0, the second 1,

    indexOf ->The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a value in a string.
     The indexOf() method returns -1 if the value is not found. The indexOf() method is case sensitive.

   lastIndexOf ->lastIndexOf() The lastIndexOf() method, given one argument: a substring to search for,
    searches the entire calling string, 
    and returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified substring.

    
\b = word boundary
g = global only when replacing
i = case insensitive (if needed) only when replacing
